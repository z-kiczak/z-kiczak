ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,
 
My name is Zuz and currently I'm pursuing my **Bachelor's in Computer Science** at the University of Warsaw (**MIM**).
I wrote my first "Hello world" program when I was 12 and I immediately fell in love ðŸ’™ During my school years
I focused on **algorithmics** and mathematics, applying the knowledge I gained at numerous **olympiads and contests**.
 
Now I'm in my last year at uni (although I will surely return for my Masters) and my passion for CS remains
just the same; on my way here I also stumbled upon **biotechnology**, which stole my heart as well - and I'm lucky
enough to have the opportunity to take the courses from the Faculty of Biology, engaging in lectures and
hands-on lab experiments ðŸ¥¼.
 
So far, the courses I enjoyed the most include Discrete Mathematics, Algebra, **Object-Oriented Programming**, Algorithms
and Data Structures, **Concurrent Programming**...this semester I'm getting to know **neural network** architectures and
I'm hacking my way through the red-team **Cybersecurity & Cryptography workshops** and lectures ðŸ‘€.

Currently I'm working on my **Bachelor's thesis**, which is a **project done in a group of 4 students** for the whole
academic year. We were given a demanding task of detecting and modelling signalling waves in several types of
mutated cell lines - but our team is not afraid of challenges and I can't wait to see the final results of our
work âœ¨

Outside of the world of tech, I enjoy playing Nintendo, hugging my cat and riding my bike around Warsaw ðŸš²
I've been skiing since I was little and I enjoy martial arts such as muay thai and Brazilian jiu-jitsu ðŸ¥‹
(although it's been some time since I was regularly training ðŸ¥¶). Whenever I have the occasion I like to travel -
this summer I was in Asia for the first time in my life and I absolutely loved it!
 
**If you're having a look at my public repositories** : please note that before joining GitHub, during first years of
my studies, I was either using GitLab account provided by my faculty, or just working on my code locally with no version
control. I've decided to move my past projects here, as single commits with no history; they may not be perfect,
and many of them were not properly finished/polished, not properly documented either, but I believe it's valuable
that I can follow my progress throughout the studies and learn from my past mistakes. There are also many past projects
that I have not moved here yet, but hopefully they will appear on my GitHub soon.
âœ¨ Enjoy âœ¨
