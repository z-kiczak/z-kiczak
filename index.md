# TIOBE Index for March 2025

The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the
popularity of programming  languages. The index is updated once a
month. The ratings are based on the number of  skilled engineers
world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sites Google,
Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are used to calculate
the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about
the best programming language or the language in which most lines of
code have been written.
