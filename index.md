# The most popular programming languages
The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of
programming  languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based
on the number of  skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors.
Popular web sites Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are
used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is
not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of
code have been written.
